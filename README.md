# VA-Pharmacy-Data-Sources

This is a repository of my notes regarding VA Pharmacy Data Sources.

At the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, data on pharmaceutical products is important to health services researchers and pharmacoepidemiologists. VA has several pharmacy data sources that offer several advantages and disadvantages.

This site is an attempt to clarify the differences between these VA Pharmacy Data Sources.

I often discover new things about the VA data, and I will update this information on this site whenever possible.

This site is for educational purposes only.
